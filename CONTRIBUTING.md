## Code of Conduct
This project is governed by the `im-web-experience` Organization's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  By participating you are expected to uphold this code.    

We ask that all members speak up if they see behavior that does not align to this Code of Conduct, so managers can take appropriate action. If you are uncomfortable discussing something with your manager, please reach out to HR.

## Development Setup
All Enterprise members should have the ability to fork any Internal repository, commit changes on the fork and submit pull requests to the upstream repository from your fork.  If you aren't familiar with working with forks check out GitHub's [forks] documentation.  You can also work with the appropriate team to be added as a collaborator so you can push to the repository directly.

Most repository `README.md` files explain how to get the project up and running.  Please read through any instructions before contacting the team.  

## Code Conventions
ExtendHealth's Coding conventions can be found in the [code-conventions] repository.

[code-conventions]: https://github.com/im-practices/code-conventions
[forks]:https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/working-with-forks

# Changes
Changes are classified as [production or non-production changes](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/HQSLEg).  If changes are expected to be release to production or impact production, they are considered production changes.  

All other changes, should still follow our [quality standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/jcFaCg) but do not need to adhere to our [SDLC Policy](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/4IMnEQ) nor [Audit Controls](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/5oMnEQ).

- Major and minor changes are indicated by a version bump using [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Versions are captured in GitHub Releases.
- Any [architectural changes](#architecture) made to this project are documented under `/docs` decisions folder as a decision record, UML diagram, sequence diagram, etc.
- [Definition of Releasability (DoR)](#definition-of-releasability) is reviewed and related strategies discussed
- If a [production change](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/HQSLEg), a [technical attestation](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ) is performed by a _technical attestor_

### Audit Evidence
Building on the WE Product Family's [Definition of Releasability](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/jcFaCg), this project's pull requests act as the _[technical attestation](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ)_.

_If the change is expected to be [released or impact production](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/HQSLEg):_
1. PR must be approved by atleast one [technical attestor](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ) certifying that the changes satisfy our [Definition of Releasability (DoC)](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/jcFaCg)
1. JIRA Story must be referenced in the PR's title, description or in its commits
1. At least one automated tests is ran in CI
1. [GitHub Release](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/nQepEQ) is generated from a successful `master` build in CI

A project repo's administrator is responsible for verifying that [any production change](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/HQSLEg) is approved by a [technical attestor](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ) on a [GitHub PR](#create-a-pull-request) and Jira work items are referenced.

# Create a Pull Request
In most cases, changes are implemented in a [Feature Branch git Workflow](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/T58QEg) style, generating a [Pull Request](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/UTWwCg) reviewed by a [technical attestor](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ).

_When creating a PR:_
- Indicate if the PR is in WIP
- Add a brief description of the changes
- Indicate if the PR is a [production change](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/HQSLEg)
  - Add JIRA Issue to title of PR
  - Add a [technical attestor](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ) as a _Reviewer_
- Add the owner of the unit of work (usually yourself) as the _Assignee_
- If UI changes, include a screenshot of those changes

> For additional details on what is expected during a PR, see [WE: Pull Request Guidelines](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/UTWwCg)

## Definition of Releasability
_Also known as our:_
#### Definition of Confidence
As part of the pull requests, parties involved in a unit of work review the [Definition of Releasability (DoR)](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/jcFaCg) strategies that pertain to the changes.

## Strategies
### Architecture Strategy
- [ ] [Coding Convention Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/LYUWD)
  - [ ] [Performance Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/yJMYCg): additional latency or load time has not been introduced?
  - [ ] [Transient Fault Handling Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/MISwCw): coded with the anticipation of failure?
  - [ ] [Security Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/84qvCQ): newly introduced logic meets our security standards?
  - [ ] [Logging Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/oZuFCg): newly introduced logic meets our logging standards?
- [ ] [UI Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/Uo-7Cg) & [Browser Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/rwNHD)

- [ ] [Documentation Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/KQApCw): new technical documentation has been added to the appropriate location?

### Risk Assessment Strategy
- [ ] Was a [risk assessment](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/o5H7Cg) performed and documented on the unit of work?
- [ ] If needed, was a [security threat model assessment](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/YJeFCg) performed and documented on the unit of work?
- [ ] [Testing Standards](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/kq5oCQ): are there any manual tests that can and should be converted to automated tests?

## Architecture
The architectural strategy follows the patterns and processes from our architecture strategy team. We approach all our stories and items weâ€™re validating by determining what bounded context the work best fits into. From there we either begin the process of creating the new bounded context services or we start the work in the existing bounded context.

- [Taxonomy](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/dByUCg)
- [Site Composition](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/DZcYCg)
- [Infrastructure](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/NZ3XCg)

> See [WE: Architecture Guidelines KB](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/861oCQ) for additional details around our architecture and its taxonomy

### Decision Records
An [Architectural Decision Record (ADR)](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/Sg_GCQ) tracks an architecture design choice, patterns to use, infrastructure to provision, standards to adopt.

_Other decision records:_
- **Service-line level**: recorded within the [GitHub Master Architecture Plan](http://github.extendhealth.com/extend-health/master-architecture-plan/tree/master/Implementation%20Decisions)
- **Product family level**: recorded within the [WE: Architecture Decision Records](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/Sg_GCQ)

> A _UML Diagram_ also acts as an ADR
