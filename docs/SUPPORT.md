# Software Development Life Cycle
Units of work are prioritized against a backlog in our [WE Jira Project](https://jira.extendhealth.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=665) by [Product Owners](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/5bNaCg) and owning teams.

In most cases, changes are implemented in a [Feature Branch git Workflow](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/T58QEg) style, generating a [Pull Request](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/UTWwCg) that is reviewed by a [technical attestor](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ).

Changes are merged into the repo's `master` branch, built & tested in CI and cleared in an integrated environment prior to deployment. 

Every [release artifact](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/nQepEQ) is cleared by a [Technical, QA and Stakeholder attestation](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/2gZmEQ), certifing that the changes satsify our [Definition of Confidence](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/jcFaCg) & [proof of testing](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/fwcnEg).

## Audit Evidence
Parts of our [Software Development Lifecycle](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/p4Q9D) process deviates from our service line's current [SDLC Process](https://kb.extendhealth.com/x/3oMnEQ).

We are responsible in providing such evidence that satisfies our SDLC Policy & Audit Controls for those changes we deploy to production.

The Pull Request, reviewed by a technical attestor, satisify the "Technical Attestation" requirment.
